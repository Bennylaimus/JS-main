 // ========================== 1st Lesson: Into to AJAX & APIs ============================== //

 AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And XML):
 Basically AJAX is all about making different browser - Javascript requests

 APIs:
 API (Application Programming Interface) (but basically it's just a way for one machine's programm
 to interact with the other machine's programm, one software with another software)

 Main idea of AJAX request is to get some API (just some data, that is received in the
 specific format called JSON), not the whole page (containing HTML, CSS and all JS scripts), but just
 some specific small amount of data.

You will ofter hear Web API termin - basically this is a HTTP based programms interactiong with
other HTTP based programms.

JSON: (Java Script Object Notation) 
 - Official wedsite: json.org
 - JSON validator: jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com

When we send an API request (in browser it is an HTTP request send from us to other browser's software)
we receive a reply:
 - we can receive it in XML format (an old less commonly used method),
 - or in JSON format - most commonly used API receive format
So it more like AJAJ (Asynschronous Javascript And Json), but everyone still says just AJAX
So bacicalley JSON - is just a way to FORMATTING DATA and transfer it in an
understandable format

 - JSON format keep an information in OBJECT - style format, but there are few differences!

 1. every key - value pair is a "" (double quoted) string
    "squadName": "Super Hero Squad",
    "formed": 2016,
    "active": true,

2. It doesn't support undefined value (it will consider it as a string) "isActive": "undefined"

Basically, when we receive a JSON reply - we receive a huge "" string and we can't really
extract a data from it.

Method we use to extract data from JSON file is:

JSON.parse("string") ===> and JSON file will be parsed into JavaScript Object

Example:

JSON parse example:
const data = { "time": { "updated": "May 5, 2023 16:35:00 UTC", "updatedISO": "2023-05-05T16:35:00+00:00", "updateduk": "May 5, 2023 at 17:35 BST" }, "disclaimer": "This data was produced from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (USD). Non-USD currency data converted using hourly conversion rate from openexchangerates.org", "chartName": "Bitcoin", "bpi": { "USD": { "code": "USD", "symbol": "&#36;", "rate": "29,520.5065", "description": "United States Dollar", "rate_float": 29520.5065 }, "GBP": { "code": "GBP", "symbol": "&pound;", "rate": "24,667.0991", "description": "British Pound Sterling", "rate_float": 24667.0991 }, "EUR": { "code": "EUR", "symbol": "&euro;", "rate": "28,757.2833", "description": "Euro", "rate_float": 28757.2833 } } }

JSON.parse(data); // ==> JSON file parsed to an object

const parsedData = JSON.parse(data) // we can the save parsed data to a variable

parsedData.time.updateduk // "2023-05-05T16:35:00+00:00" // and we can now work with it like with an object and extract data as it is an object

Or we can go to other 'direction' and get some data from our object to be putted and parsed to a JSON file

Method we use for this is:

JSON.stringify(data)
(we replace all undefined's with a null)

Example:

let info = {
    animal: 'dog',
    age: 15,
    isHomeless: false,
    owner: undefined,
};

let toJson = JSON.stringify(info);
console.log(toJson); // output: {"animal":"dog","age":15,"isHomeless":false} (no undefined, as JSON do not accept it!)
