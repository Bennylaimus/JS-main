***1. Introducing of Node.js****

Until recentrly, we could run JavaScript code in a web browser.
Node is a JavaScript runtime that executes code OUTSIDE OF THE browser

We can use the same JavaScript syntax we know and love to write SERVER-SIDE CODE,
instead of relying on other languages like Python or Ruby.

***2. Node REPL***

REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print loop.
Inside a Node REPL we can type a JavaScripts commands (we are now in the 'word of JavaScript')

For example:
1 + 2 // 3
'hello' + 'world' // 'helloworld'

But some browser staff doesn't exist in REPL, for example global 'window' objects
Instead of 'browser's' window REPL has his own object - called 'global'

NEW stuff in Node.js REPL:
Node comes with a buch of build-in modules that don't exist in the browser.
These modules help us do things like interact with the operating sustem and files/folders.

NOT included in the Node.js REPL:
Because Node does not run in a browser, we don't habe access to all the browser "stuff".
The 'window', 'document' and DOM API's are not a thing in Node!

***3 Running the Node files (running files with node)***

We can run JS files (from our VSCode for example) in the terminal (in the general Bash terminal, not in the Node REPL)
by using keyword 'node'
1) Create a file in the basic terminal (Bash terminal) touch myfile.js
2) Open this created file in the VSCode and write some JS code there (for loop for example)
3) Execute the JS code in ther file in the terminal (Bash terminal) by saying: 'node myfile.js'

You can also indicate a longer 'way' to that file, for example: node JavaScript/myfile.js
